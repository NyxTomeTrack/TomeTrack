Short description

TomeTrack is a reading app that helps you track your books, follow your progress, and connect with readers who care about stories as much as you do.

Long description

TomeTrack is built for readers who want more control over how they read and how they engage with books.

The app allows you to track what you are reading, what you plan to read, and what you have finished, all in one place. You can follow your progress chapter by chapter, keep notes and highlights, and return to them whenever you need. The reading experience is designed to stay out of the way, with clear typography, adjustable settings, and a dark-first interface that supports long, focused sessions.

Beyond personal reading, TomeTrack brings readers together. You can discover books through community activity, join discussions, and share thoughts without pressure to perform or compete. The emphasis is on thoughtful reading and genuine connection, not ratings for their own sake.

TomeTrack also respects how readers access books. You can choose to buy digital copies from official retailers or upload your own legally owned documents. Your library stays yours, organized in a way that reflects how you actually read.

At its core, TomeTrack is about ownership, clarity, and community. Your reading habits, your pace, your space to think, and a place to connect with others who value books as more than just a list to finish.
